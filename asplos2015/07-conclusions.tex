Current OS page placement policies are optimized for both homogeneous memory and
latency sensitive systems.  We propose a new BW-AWARE page placement policy that
uses memory system information about heterogeneous memory system characteristics to place data
appropriately, achieving 35\% performance improvement on average over existing
policies without requiring any application awareness.  In future CC-NUMA
systems,
BW-AWARE placement improves the performance optimal capacity by better using
all system resources. But some applications may wish to size their problems
based on total capacity rather than performance. In such cases, we provide insight into
how to optimize data placement by using the CDF of the application in
combination with application annotations enabling intelligent runtime
controlled page placement decisions.  We propose a profile-driven application
annotation scheme that enables improved placement without requiring any
runtime page migration. While only the beginning of a fully automated
optimization system for memory placement, we believe that the performance gap between the current
best OS INTERLEAVE policy and the annotated performance (min 1\%, avg 20\%, max
2x) is enough that further work in this area is warranted as mobile, desktop,
and HPC memory systems all move towards mixed CPU-GPU CC-NUMA heterogeneous memory systems.
