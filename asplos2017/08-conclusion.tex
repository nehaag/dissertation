\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
With recent announcements of XPoint 3D memory by Intel/Micron there is an
opportunity of cutting cost of memories in data centers with improved capacity
and cost per bit. However, due to projected higher access latencies of these new
memory technologies it is not feasible to completely replace main memory DRAM
technology. To address the renewed interest in two-tiered physical memory we
presented and evaluated Thermostat, an application-transparent huge-page-aware
mechanism to place pages in a dual technology hybrid memory system, while
achieving both the cost advantages of two-tiered memory and performance
advantages of transparent huge pages. Huge page being performance critical in
cloud applications with large memory footprints, especially in virtualized cloud
environments, need to be supported in this two-tier memory system. We present a
new hot/cold classification mechanism to distinguish frequently accessed pages
(hot) from infrequently accessed ones (cold).  We implement Thermostat in
Linux kernel version 4.5 and show that it can transparently move cold data to slow memory
while satisfying a 3\% tolerable slowdown. We show that our online
cold page identification mechanism incurs no observable performance overhead and
can migrate up to 50\% of application footprint to slow memory while limiting
performance degradation to 3\%, thereby reducing memory cost up to 30\%.
