Cold data at 4KB granularity vs 2MB granularity. Use figure to show quantify
HotSpot pages within an otherwise cold huge page.

Show analytical analysis of putting pages in slow memory and opportunity to make
slow memory usable in data centers.

Discuss performance-cost trade-off for data centers.

Why are previous 2-level memory techniques inadeqaute in solving this issue.

Re-iterate the problem we are solving and the central idea of our solution.
